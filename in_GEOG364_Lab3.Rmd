# Welcome to Lab 3!

**Aim of the lab**


\

**Deadline & Late Penalty**

-   Tuesday lab: to add
-   Thursday lab: to add
-   Friday lab: to add

\

**What to submit**

You will submit both your Rmd and HTML files.

\

**How long should the lab take?**

To add.

**Getting help**
-   Kiely (and often Dr G) will be present during your lab sessions. This is the easiest way to get help.
-   There is a Piazza discussion board. Kiely will explain more in this week’s lab and will check it at least once a day.
-   Dr G has weekly office hours and genuinely enjoys helping with R, even if you feel stuck or overwhelmed.
-   If you have posted on Piazza and received no response after 24 hours, you may send a Canvas message to Kiely or Dr G (or if you are completely lost).\

# Set-up. DON'T SKIP!

### Create a project & get the data

There are two options here depending on whether you are using R-studio on the website (posit cloud) or your own computer (R-Desktop). If you are using a lab computerm choose the R-Desktop route.

#### Option 1. Posit Cloud Website Users

<details>

<summary>Task 1. Get the data from Canvas</summary>

<br>

Go to the Lab 3 Canvas page and download the dataset `Lab03_house.xlsx` <br>

</details>

<summary>Task 2. Create a project for Lab 3 (expand for instructions)</summary>

<summary>Task 3. Upload your dataset to the website. (expand for reminder)</summary>

</details>

::: small-gap
:::

<details>

<summary>Task 4. Install more packages (expand for instructions)</summary>

<br>

Unfortunately on the website you need to install your packages each time.<br>Go to to the packages tab, click install to get to the app-store and download/install these packages:

-   `readxl`
-   `viridis`
-   `ggstatsplot`
-   `terra`
-   `tigris`
-   `tidyverse`
-   `dplyr`
-   `tmap`
-   `elevatr`
-   `osmdata`

We will also need a package called sf, which runs a lot of the spatial commands in R. Unfortunately, posit cloud sometimes has a few technical issues with sf, so you will need to run a special command.

IN THE CONSOLE, run these two commands.

```{r,eval=FALSE}
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github(repo = "r-spatial/sf", ref = "93a25fd8e2f5c6af7c080f92141cb2b765a04a84")
```

<summary>Task 2. Get the data & **put in your Lab 3 folder**</summary>

<br>

Go to the Lab 3 Canvas page and download the dataset `Lab03_house.xlsx`. **Put it in your lab 3 folder.**

</details>

::: small-gap
:::

<details>

<summary>Task 3. Install some packages</summary>

<br>

We need to install some more packages.<br>Go to to the packages tab, click install to get to the app-store and download/install these packages. If your computer says its missing a package later on, install anything it suggests.

-   `elevatr`
-   `osmdata`

Remember DO NOT put `install.packages()` into your lab-script - copy and paste it into thee console.

### Set-up your Lab 3 report

You are welcome to use/edit the template you made in lab 2. If you are unsure what I mean by that, follow these instructions.

<details>

<summary>Task. Create your RMarkdown file - expand & look at Tutorial 4B and 4C</summary>

<details>

<summary>Task. Edit your YAML code</summary>

<br>

Lets use similar options to Lab 2, although you could try a different theme.  Remember YAML code is annoying to edit, because here, *spaces really do matter*. Everything has to be perfect or it won't knit.

**Select everything in my code chunk here and replace your YAML with this (remember the --- on line 1 and at the end).**

Now edit the author name to your own.  If you wonder what Sys.Date() is, don't touch it - it automatically gives you the current date.

```{r,eval=FALSE}

---
title: "GEOG-364 - Lab 3"
author: "hlg5155"
date: "`r Sys.Date()`"
output:
  html_document:
    toc: true
    toc_float: yes
    number_sections: yes
    theme: lumen
    df_print: paged
---
  
  
```





</details>

::: small-gap
:::

<details>

<summary>Task. Change the theme and knit</summary>

<br>

In the YAML code, change the theme to any one of your choice that isn't not lumen (see here to view available themes -
<https://bootswatch.com/>.). <br>

Some might not work, but these are likely to: “default”, “bootstrap”, “cerulean”, “cosmo”, “darkly”, “flatly”, “journal”, “lumen”, “paper”, “readable”, “sandstone”, “simplex”, “spacelab”, “united”, “yeti”.

</details>

::: small-gap
:::

<details>

<summary>Task. Clean the file and create/run your library code chunk</summary>

<br>

 - Click on your lab script (the Rmd file) and delete all the 'welcome text' after line 11.<br>Press enter a few times and make a new level-1 heading called `Set Up`.<br>

 - We should have all the packages we need installed, but we need to open them. Make a new code chunk containing this code.<br>

```{r,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
library(readxl)
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(terra)
library(sf)
library(tmap)
library(elevatr)
library(osmdata)
```

<br>

 - Press the green arrow on the right of the code chunk to run the code inside it. You will see a load of "loading text" telling your details about the packages you just loaded.<br><br> Press the green arrow AGAIN. The text should disappear unless there is an error.<br>

-   Note, remember to run this code chunk EVERY TIME your start R-Studio (in the same way you need to click on an app on your phone before you can use it). <br>

<br>

</details>

::: small-gap
:::

<details>

<summary>Task. Add warning=FALSE and message=FALSE to your library code chunk.
</summary>


<br>

 - Expand here for a tutorial.

### Check your progress

Your lab script should now look similar this, but with your theme and YAML options of choice (you might have a few different libraries than in my screenshot). You should also be able to knit it successfully. If not, go back and do the previous sections!

# MAIN ANALYSIS

Goal: understand which factors influence house prices in Sindian District, New Taipei City, Taiwan, and communicate results to a non-technical reader.

## Read and prepare the data

2. Read into R (read_excel) and check structure

3. Clean and rename columns if needed

4. Convert to spatial object (st_as_sf, crs = 4326)

## Define the study and data context

5. State the decision problem (friend/boss house-buying question)

6. Define the population of interest and discuss representativeness

7. Describe key variables and their units (response = House.Price). Inc Summary statistics and distribution of House.Price (mean, median, range, IQR – and histogram)

8. Note any data limitations (temporal coverage, sample bias, missing variables)

9. Discuss spatial fallacies/properties e.g. locational fallacy? (nope) etc etc


## Add more data

### Elevation raster (get_elev_raster)

10. Get elevation

### OpenStreetMap

11. OpenStreetMap features: railway lines, stations, parks, roads

## Spatial analysis and mapping

12. Quick interactive map of points coloured by price (tmap, qtm)

13. Main map from my example

14. Describe spatial patterns

15. Simple linear regression (price ~ latitude)  
Use maps to explain the scatterplots e.g. should I just walk north

## Conclusions

16. What processes are happening? Summarise main drivers of price from combined evidence
Discuss practical implications for a house-buyer

## Overall

Overall, here is what your lab should correspond to:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(rubric) %>%   
  kable_classic_2() %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "responsive"))

```

And..
finished!
