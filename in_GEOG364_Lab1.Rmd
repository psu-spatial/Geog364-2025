# Welcome to Lab 1! {#Lab1 .unnumbered}


### Introduction

This lab builds directly on what you covered in Homework 1 on DataCamp. The goal is to get comfortable using R and R-Markdown, and to learn how some of the key pieces fit together. In Lab 2, we will explore similar ideas but with spatial data

In this lab, you will learn how to 

 - Set up an R-Studio Project
 - Create & edit a R-Markdown document
 - Install and use Libraries
 - Load data
 - Create summary statistics for different types of data
 - Explore how GEOG-464 labs are structured and what you need to submit

**You are allowed to use your own laptops, Posit-Cloud or the lab computers (very slow) to complete this lab.**

# Before You Begin

::: {#boxgreen}

**IF YOU HAVEN'T COMPLETED HOMEWORK 1, GO AND DO IT NOW!** <br><br> This lab builds on Homework 1, so it's important you complete it first. [Click here to go to the homework](https://psu.instructure.com/courses/2396422/assignments/17466225). <br><br>  *I have extended the deadline just this once because it's an important starting point for your labs*.  

::: 

\

# Getting Started

### **Step 1: Open R-Studio (or Posit Cloud online)**

 - If you are using your own computer or the lab desktop, open the R-STUDIO icon [not the one that says R](https://psu-spatial.github.io/Stat462-2025/index_images/pg_Tut2_startup_fig1.png).
 - If you are planning to use posit cloud online, go here and log in - https://posit.cloud/content/yours

\

### **Step 2: Set up a project for Lab 1**

An R Project is like a home base for all the files, scripts, and data connected to one piece of work. Instead of saving files in lots of different places and then struggling to tell R where to look, the Project keeps everything together. Here's why projects are so useful:

 - **Consistency across computers:** If you move from Posit Cloud to a lab computer or your own laptop, you only need to copy the Project folder. Open it, and everything inside will still “know where it lives.”

 - **No messy file paths:** You won’t have to keep typing or updating long folder names. R will automatically treat your Project folder as the starting point.

 - **Everything is organised:** Each lab, assignment, or project has its own container, so your work never gets tangled.

 - **Easy to share or back up:** You can zip up the folder, send it, or store it in GitHub/OneDrive, and it will still work when reopened.

1.  You need to create a new project for every single lab! <br> **Today, use these instructions to create a project for Lab 1:** <br><br> If you are using your own computer or a lab computer, click here [Tutorial: R-Studio Desktop](https://psu-spatial.github.io/Stat462-2025/CH2_EACHLAB.html#11_Projects_using_R-Studio_Desktop) <br> If you are using posit cloud online (the website), click here [Tutorial: Posit Cloud online](https://psu-spatial.github.io/Stat462-2025/CH2_EACHLAB.html#12_Projects_using_Posit_Cloud) <br><br>

\

### **Step 3: Changing your global settings**

Before you start using RStudio, it helps to adjust a few settings to make your lives easier. 

2.  Click here [Tutorial: Global settings](https://psu-spatial.github.io/Stat462-2023/in_S462_Tutorial01WhatisR.html#changing-global-settings) and follow the instructions to change your global settings & appearance.


\

### **Step 4: Understanding R-Markdown Files**

You are going to write up your labs as R-Markdown files. These can include both code and text - and they are easy to turn into websites, pdf documents, presentations and many other things.

## Overall

Overall, here is what your lab should correspond to:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(rubric) %>%   
  kable_classic_2() %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "responsive"))

```

And..
finished!
