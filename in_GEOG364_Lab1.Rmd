# Welcome to Lab 1!

**You are allowed to use your own laptops, Posit-Cloud or the lab computers (very slow) to complete this lab.**

### Introduction

This lab builds directly on what you covered in Homework 1 on DataCamp. The goal is to get comfortable using R and R Markdown, and to learn how some of the key pieces fit together. 

In this lab, you will learn how to 

 - Set up an R-Studio Project
 - Create & edit a R-Markdown document
 - Install and use Libraries
 - Load data
 - Create summary statistics for different types of data
 - Explore how GEOG-464 labs are structured and what you need to submit

*In Lab 2, we will explore similar ideas but with spatial data.*

# Before You Begin

::: {#boxgreen}

**IF YOU HAVEN'T COMPLETED HOMEWORK 1, GO AND DO IT NOW!** <br><br> This lab builds on Homework 1, so it's important you complete it first. [Click here to go to the homework](https://psu.instructure.com/courses/2396422/assignments/17466225). <br><br>  *I have extended the deadline just this once because it's an important starting point for your labs*.  

::: 

\

# Getting Started

#### Step 1: Opening R. 

 - If you are using your own computer or the lab desktop, open the R-STUDIO icon (not the one that says R).
 - If you are planning to use posit cloud online, go here and log in - https://posit.cloud/content/yours

\

#### Step 2: Setting up a project 

An R-project stores everything to do with each lab in one place on your computer. This is incredibly useful - it means that if you switch from R-Cloud, to the lab computers, to your laptop, all you have to do is to move the folder and everything will just work. It also means you have to worry less about directory names.

1.  Create a new project for Lab 1, in order to store your data, analysis & reports. <br><br> If you are using your own computer or a lab computer, [Tutorial: R-Studio Desktop](https://psu-spatial.github.io/Stat462-2025/CH2_EACHLAB.html#11_Projects_using_R-Studio_Desktop) <br> If you are using posit cloud online (the website version), [Tutorial: Posit Cloud online](https://psu-spatial.github.io/Stat462-2025/CH2_EACHLAB.html#12_Projects_using_Posit_Cloud) <br><br>

### Changing the global settings

I know many of you did this last 

1.  Create a new project for Project 2, in order to store your data, analysis & reports. <br> Instructions here <https://psu-spatial.github.io/Stat462-2025/CH2_EACHLAB.html#1_R-Projects>

# Show me something new!

For example, 

 - You could follow these instructions, install a custom theme and include a screenshot in your lab report (https://www.garrickadenbuie.com/project/rsthemes/)

# Grading rubric

## Overall

Overall, here is what your lab should correspond to:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(rubric) %>%   
  kable_classic_2() %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "responsive"))

```

And..
finished!
